    The repository https://github.com/elhenrico/covid19-Brazil-timeseries/blob/master/deaths-new.csv
    constains Brazil's dated deaths from COVID19.
    To import data form WEB on Excel, it's needed to access the "RAW" data format

Editing the data:
    Define the header 
    Transforming columns into rows
    Naming the column 
    Explicitly setting the data format

Collecting data from individual states:
    Creating dynamic table

Displaying data from individual states:
    Creating Brazil's map with states data

Analysing Brazil death numbers over time:
    Filtering Brazil from data setting
    Applying a "m√©dia movel" algorithm over the data to soften the curve and consider errors on daily sampling
        (deaths on the weekend are logged only at the begging of the week)
    Plotting data on a curve graph (deaths over time)

Analysing percentage of deaths per Brazil's regions:
    New dynamic table to extract data

Mounting a dashboard to finish the analysis

Analysing accumulated deaths per country:
    Data from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv
    Gather multiple country regions data using dynamic tables
    Add continent and flag to each country
    Upload data on "bar chart race" from https://app.flourish.studio/templates
