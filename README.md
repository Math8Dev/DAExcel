# the Project

It is a simple application to show some of my knowledges on analysing data on Excel.

It shows some COVID-19 death numbers data on diffente regions per period. 

I have used features as:
- pivot tables ("tabela din√¢mica")
- filters
- web data access
- plotting graphs and maps
- conditional formatting
